# Official leo features plugin

Leo is a new programming language built with intuitive semantics to enable developers to write applications that are private-by-default and formally verified.

Aleo programs are files with a .aleo extension. Aleo programs contain Aleo instructions - an assembly-like programming language. Aleo instructions are compiled into AVM opcodes that can be executed by the Aleo Virtual Machine.
